# Docker_Kafka

Since I am practicing the Kafka and Docker. I imported a lot of Confluent Docker Images which my machine is overflooded with. I want to clean them.

For cleaning. 



```text

# For Listing all the images

docker ps -a

# For removing all the container or the images. 

docker rm $(docker ps -aq)

```
